# cs50_public
In this repo you can see my CS50 problem sets running at the command line. Due to the course's policies on academic honesty, I am keeping all the source code for these exercises in a private CS50 repo. Below you will find the first problem set, and I plan on producing a similar markdown file for each problem set completed in the course that can be displayed in this fashion.

<strong>Problem Set 1:</strong> 
There were two versions of this problem set available to students. One version was intended for students who felt more comfortable programming, and the other was for students who felt less comfortable programming. I completed both problems sets, which amounted to 4 different exercises in C.

In Mario for less comfortable students, I was asked to create a pyramid in C using hashes (#) for bricks. The user should decide the height of the pyramid, between 1 and 8 bricks high inclusive. And I should evaluate the correctness of my code using check50.

In Mario for more comfortable students, I was asked to create adjacent pyramids in C using hashes (#) for bricks. The user should decide the height of the two pyramids, between 1 and 8 bricks high inclusive. The gap between the two pyramids should be equal to the width of two hashes. And I should evaluate the correctness of my code using check50.
