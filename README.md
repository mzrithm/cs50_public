**This is CS50. Problem Set 1.**

In this repo you can see my CS50 problem sets running at the command line. Due to the course's policies on academic honesty, I am keeping all the source code for these exercises in a private CS50 repo.

I plan on producing a similar markdown file for each problem set in the course... eventually. ðŸ¤“

- Check out [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) if you're interested in a challenging & comprehensive introduction to Computer Science.

- Check out [asciinema](https://github.com/asciinema) if you're interested in sharing your terminal sessions.

**Problem Set 1:**

There were two versions of this problem set available to students. One version was intended for students who felt more comfortable programming, and the other was for students who felt less comfortable programming. 

I completed both problems sets, which amounted to 4 different exercises in C.

**mario/less :**
- In Mario for less comfortable students, you create a pyramid in C using hashes (#) for bricks. The user inputs the height of the pyramid and the input must be an integer between 1 and 8 (inclusive).

**mario/more :**
- In Mario for more comfortable students, you create adjacent pyramids in C using hashes (#) for bricks. The user inputs the height of the two pyramids and the input must be an integer between 1 and 8 (inclusive). The gap between the two pyramids should be equal to the width of two hashes.

**And that's all there is to Problem Set 1!** ðŸ˜Ž
