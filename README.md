In this repo you can see my CS50 problem sets running at the command line. No source code. :)

<strong>Problem Set 1:</strong> 
There were two versions of this problem set available to students. One version was intended for students who felt more comfortable programming, and the other was for students who felt less comfortable programming. I completed both problems sets, which amounted to 4 different exercises in C.

cs50/pset1/mario/more^
Create adjacent pyramids in C using hashes (#) for bricks. The user should decide the height of the two pyramids, between 1 and 8 bricks high inclusive. The gap between the two pyramids should be equal to the width of two hashes. Evaluate the correctness of your code using check50.
